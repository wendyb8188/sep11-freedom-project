# SEP11 Freedom Project
by Wendy Bazan Galindo

## Context
The "Freedom Project" for SEP11 is all about creating an interactive program that uses Javascript (coding language) and a tool of one's own choice (JS library, framework...etc). The purpose of this blog is to show people how Javascript can be used to make a functional interactive program which can be applied to the real world.  

## Content
For my project, I made a platformer game. These blogs will walk through my process of independently studying [kaboom](https://kaboomjs.com/) in order to create an inspiring, fun game!

## Implications
My platformer game is meant to serve as a form of entertainment.
