# SEP11 Freedom Project
by Wendy Bazan Galindo

## Context
The "Freedom Project" for SEP11 is all about creating an interactive program that uses Javascript (coding language) and a tool of one's own choice (JS library, framework...etc). The purpose of this blog is to show how Javascript can be used to make a functional interactive program which can be applied to the real world.  

## Content
For my project, I made a platformer game. These blogs will walk through my process of independently studying [kaboom](https://kaboomjs.com/) in order to create an inspiring, fun game! In this blog, I will explain how platformer games can be implemented in three different ways: Socially, Globally, Economically. 

## Take a look at the links below:

## Implications
My platformer game is meant to serve as a form of entertainment. 
My project is a platformer game that affects us, people around us, and systems around us including globally, socially, and economically. Globally (government/laws, big systems, environment), platform games like mine, can help teachers inspire and ecourage students to learn how to code to create their own games online. Not only is this more accessible, but is a way to conserve natural resources that you would need to use to create a board game. Socially (individual, relationships, etc.), platformer games can cause an individual's screen time to rise causing them to become islolated from society and even lead to the individuals relationship with their loved ones to deteriorate. Economically (jobs, finance, infrastructure), it provides job opportunities for people like programmers
