# Entry 1: Kaboom The Tool!
##### 11/7/22
Through the course of several weeks, I was tasked to choose a tool for the creation of the end of the year interactive program we choose to create. Initially though, I was told to make a selection from [this](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oJFrErlAZvB-0V923QGOm4X3CwiceJsKot2R6Jz8Mdc/preview) list to create a main project idea and a backup project idea with a tool that correlated with each one. I made my selection based on the level I felt was right for me, challenging, but not to the extreme. Here is the list I created: <br>
1) Main Idea: A game to help improve skills (memory-cards, dexterity- drawing, concentration- puzzles, reaction- levels with running/escaping...e.g.)
    * Main tool(s): [Kaboom.js](https://kaboomjs.com/) ([intro](https://replit.com/site/kaboom)/[ml5js](https://ml5js.org/) ([tutorials](https://learn.ml5js.org/#/reference/image-classifier?id=tutorials)) (TBD) 
3) Backup Idea: Questionnaire game for entertainment with people (Jeopardy/guess who/ice-breakers)
    * Backup tool: Hotkeys (original website - “A robust Javascript library for capturing keyboard input”) <br>

After researching each tool, I asked myself what I felt I was most interested in and what I thought I would enjoy making more. Next, I was told to focus on one of my ideas and tools. I choose to learn more about Kaboom.js to make a platformer game with the possibility of having levels. I begun by watching a guide on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/iRXI6ThRJvM) ([tips](https://blog.ourcade.co/posts/2021/5-tips-getting-started-kaboom-js/)) and informing myself about the pros/cons and looking at examples by reading an [article](https://www.gamedesigning.org/learn/kaboom-js/), then I moved on to tinkering with Kaboom by testing the [playground](https://kaboomjs.com/play?demo=add) section and tinkering with the code while using google to search up any small questions I had, and took notes on ideas for my game and what objects/components I could use in the future. Below are a few of the ideas for using Kaboom to make my game: 
* collison: 
  * Block things (“the walls”) from sprite 
    * Out: establish border
  * Once sprite touches “enemy/trap” → restart/penalty
* level:
  * 5 levels? (easy → hard)
* kaboom:
  * Loses (“dies”)/Sprite gets hurt (“attacked/fails obstacle” → use kaboom (“explosion effect”)
* buttons:
  * Start/Quit/Restart?/Pause?Instructions?
* runner:
  * Time the sprite, until it wins?
  * Set a time limit?
* movement: 
  * Sprites direction
  * Good idea for maze
* gravity/doublejump:
  * Space → jump
* rpg: 
  * Use for hints
  * Use for keys ( → escape level)
* platformer:
  * Form of land (sky, ground, neutral?)
* ai: 
  * Could it be used for an enemy or friend? 
<br> 
The reason I chose to use Kaboom rather than the other tools is because I felt it really worked well with me, the others were in my opinion were confusing and hard to follow. The first time I saw Kaboom, I had this gut feeling that was telling me to learn more about it, and when I did, I realized that even if I understood any other tool, I had already chosen Kaboom from the start and I wasn’t going to change it. When I created my notes/ideas from tinkering and using the playground, I was driven by the idea of creating some sort of platformer game which was inspired by an  article that I ran into on my phone through an AD: https://www.mentalup.co/.

Last year in 10th grade, I learned that you can be anywhere in the engineering design process (EDP) and don’t just have to do it in one step, but in several. Right now, I believe I’m in the process of brainstorming possible ideas (solutions) while also being in the process of defining and researching unknown information (problems). I enjoyed this part of the process of selecting a tool and feel it will be a nice learning process as I plan my objective and continue to learn more about the functionality of my tool. 
<br></br>
Through this year-long project I will be working on the development and practicing of various skills. However, as of right now I feel like I practiced learning how to use the skills “How to learn” and “How to Google”. From learning about different tools, I came to the selection of Kaboom. In the process of learning about Kaboom, I used google to answer questions I had to find the solution.
