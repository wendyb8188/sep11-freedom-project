# Entry 6
##### 5/28/23

### Context
I have officially completed my platformer game. Previously, I worked on finishing my minimal viable product and later moved on to adding last minute touches to the game. In this final entry, I will go over my experience of presenting my final product to people and the takeaways I learned from this. 

### Content
#### Expo Elevator Pitch
This is referring to a 1 minute presentation where we showcase our year-long project to students, teachers, and judges. We were graded based off this rubric:

Based off this, I created a short presentation:

* Elevator pitch ([1 minute Presentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hzTOBQP2Cji-aSnAKS0527_g-DXJw4pvd88NT5U-VTA/edit#bookmark=id.pnij3ytr6bh8))
* Hi! My name is Wendy.
* In front of us is a game I created by applying my knowledge on Javascript, a coding language, through Kaboom, a library for Javascript, which I learned on my own. 
* As you may have noticed, it takes place in a supermarket. Why? Well itâ€™s because of these (shows figurines) figurines I used to collect when I was younger called shopkins, these were my inspiration for the game. The main sprite was inspired by the fruit (show) and the enemy was inspired by this basket (show).
* My game is meant to be a form of entertainment, so whenever you feel bored, you can try to beat my game! There are 3 levels, as you move forward the level of difficulty increases. The goal is to collect 24 hearts, avoid enemies, and reach the exit by using the left and right arrow to move and the up arrow to jump.
* Feel free to take a look at the code and I encourage you to try out my game!
* If you have any questions, I'll be happy to answer them!

I presented to 3 judges, two of them were seniors in HS and the other one was an assistant principal of math, science, and computer science. At first, I was really nervous, but after I presented two the first senior I felt more at ease that when it was time to present to the others, I was more excited than nervous. 
#### In-Class Presentation
This was a formal presentation in class which went more in-depth about everything I learned from the entire journey. Below is the rubric:

Below is the feedback I got from my teacher (seeing this made me feel extremely happy, thankful, and proud):

### Below are some takeaways from these experience:
* It is important to be approachable, so that you leave a good impression on people (smile, be friendly, and greet them immediately)
    * In the beginning of high school, I didn't put in a lot of effort to grab peoples attention, but as I practiced more often, I realized that sometimes people need encouraging. Looking back to my older presentations, I feel like I've improved in many ways including making eye contact and projecting my voice
* Distractions aren't meant to stump you, they are meant to give you time to think and improvise
    * During the beginning of the 1-minute presentation, I was stopped by a teacher passing by who wanted to try out my game, she apologized (didn't realize I was being judged) and I continued to present. I think that this made my presentation even better and taught me to improvise or as some might say "go with the flow."
    * In the longer presentation, I was so focused on the presentation that when my classmates laughed at a joke I made, I lost my train of thought because of their laughter, so I was forced to think in the spot and it turned out great.
    
### Engineering Design Process
At this instant, I am in the final stage: "Communicate the results." 

### Skills
Communication: articulating ideas to your partner, writing in your portfolio, public speaking in presentations.
Creativity: how to think outside the box, be innovative, and create the future.
