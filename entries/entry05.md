# Entry 5
##### 4/23/23

### Context
In my previous entries, I created a [platformer mini-game](https://replit.com/@wendyb8188/Game-Scene-mini-game?v=1) and worked on making progress towards my Minimal Viable Product using [Kaboom](https://kaboomjs.com/). 

### Goal(s)
1) My first goal was to finish my MVP!!!
2) My second goal was to do learn more about Kaboom to go BEYOND MVP (later on) by doing research and tinkering 

### MVP


### *The Just About Final Learnings*

### Engineering Design Process
As of right now, I feel like I am in two stages: "Create a Prototype" AND "Test and Evaluate the Prototype." As I *created* my projoct, I *tested* and *evaluated* it to have a platformer game by doing the least I can do to make it work.

### Skills
Through the process of bringing my game to life, I felt like I used the skills "Debugging" and "Growth Mindset." As I created my project, I ran into multiple errors which I had to *debug* by tinkering and tackling them one by one. While debugging, I worked on developing a *growth mindset* by being patient, preserving through the challenges, and asking for help when I had no idea what to do anymore. 

### The Results
After many entries speaking about a project using Kaboom, I finally created that long-awaited project... Here is the [link](https://replit.com/@wendyb8188/FreedomProject?v=1) to my MVP!!! :D 

### Next Steps
IMPLEMENT my learnings to go beyond MVP.
