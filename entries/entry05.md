# Entry 5
##### 4/23/23

### Context
In my previous entries, I created a [platformer mini-game](https://replit.com/@wendyb8188/Game-Scene-mini-game?v=1) and worked on making progress towards my Minimal Viable Product using Kaboom. 

### Goal(s)
1) My first goal was to finish my MVP!!!
2) My second goal was to do learn more about Kaboom to go BEYOND MVP (later on) by doing research and tinkering 

### MVP


### *The Just About Final Learnings*


### The Results
After many entries speaking about a project using Kaboom, I finally created that long-awaited project... Here is the [link](https://replit.com/@wendyb8188/FreedomProject?v=1) to my MVP!!! :D 

### Next Steps
IMPLEMENT my learnings to go beyond MVP.
