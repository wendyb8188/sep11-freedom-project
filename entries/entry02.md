# Entry 2: Kaboom Learning Introduction!
##### 12/19/2022

### Context
In my previous blog entry, I wrote about choosing a tool for my freedom project, I ended up electing [Kaboom](https://kaboomjs.com) which is a Javascript game programming library. Through the use of a website called [Replit](https://replit.com) which is used to create and share software, I learned about Kaboom.  

### Task
The task I gave myself was creating a mini-game that is similiar to the [dino game](https://kaboomjs.com) that appears when the internet goes out following [this](https://kaboomjs.com/doc/intro) tutorial on kaboom. 

### The Learning 
During this journey to create a running mini-game, I faced many struggles in which helped me learn about Kaboom. Here are challenges in which I faced and what I learned from each challenge:

* Challenge #1
  * Learning #1
* Challenge #2
  * Learning #2
* Challenge #3
